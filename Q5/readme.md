<h1>Explanations</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The actual value that is calculated is the annual sharpe ratio of the portfolio.</li>
  <li>The dataset provided for the chosen securities (HDFC, ITC and RELIANCE) was not adjusted for stock splits and dividends. This was done and the dataset was pruned according to need.</li>
  <li>The Risk-Free Rate of Return was calculated on the 10Y G-Sec Bond Yield whose dataset was sourced from investing.com.</li>
  <li>The code is entirely modular and will work with any dataset for any asset, provided that they are formatted similarly to each other and the current data.</li>
  <li>I chose to use a pythons virtualenv so you will have to activate it from the Scripts folder and then use it, without the need to install any libraries.</li>
  <li>All the code is in the Src folder and the Q5 folder is the actual virtualenv.</li>
</ul>
